## Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is a core optimization algorithm used to **minimize loss functions** by iteratively updating model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient. It is essential in **machine learning**, helping models like linear and logistic regression fit data effectively, and in **deep learning**, enabling neural networks with millions of parameters to learn complex patterns efficiently. Variants such as **batch, stochastic, and mini-batch gradient descent** make it flexible for datasets of all sizes.
